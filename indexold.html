	Phi Gamma Delta strives to provide guidance to innately exceptional men living in a university environment, with the aim of transforming them into outstanding members of society. To pursue this goal, the Fraternity promotes its five core values:
	          Friendship, brings us together and is the foundation of our brotherhood. At Fiji you will meet people who you will see as friends, not only for college, but for life.
	          Knowledge, is the primary reason that we attend university. Education is a gateway to success and leads to a richer, fuller life.
	         Service, in recognition of our obligation to give back to our campus and community that provides us with countless opportunities for growth.
	          Morality, our commitment to do what is right in all situations and to have respect for every relationship that cross our path in life.
	          Excellence, the acknowledgement that it is an honor to be a FIJI and that the Fraternity works to achieve the full potential of the chapter and its individual members.
